DCP Framework

A Constraint-Based Framework for Structured Judgment and Layered Interpretation

⸻

Overview

The DCP Framework (Decision / Constraint / Condition-based Process) is a conceptual framework for reasoning under constraints.

It provides a structured way to describe how judgments, interpretations, and evaluations emerge when information is incomplete, heterogeneous, or context-dependent.

Rather than producing definitive answers, DCP makes explicit the conditions, assumptions, references, and uncertainties that shape a judgment, allowing reasoning processes to remain transparent, traceable, and revisable.

中文簡介（Chinese Overview）

DCP（判定約束框架）是一套用於描述「在條件限制下如何形成判定」的概念性方法框架。

它不追求單一正確答案，而是強調：
	•	判定所依賴的條件
	•	使用的參考與依據
	•	推論過程中的不確定性
	•	不同層級之間的詮釋關係

透過這種方式，使判斷過程本身可以被檢視、比較、重構與延伸。

What This Framework Is

English

The DCP Framework can be understood as:
	•	A meta-framework for structured judgment
	•	A way to describe reasoning under explicit constraints
	•	A scaffold for layered interpretation
	•	A reusable pattern for comparison, analysis, and evaluation
	•	A conceptual foundation applicable across domains

It is intentionally abstract and does not prescribe specific implementations.

中文

DCP 是：
	•	一種「結構化判定」的元框架
	•	用來描述受條件限制下的推理方式
	•	支援分層詮釋與多視角理解
	•	可重複使用的分析與比較結構
	•	可跨領域套用的概念基底

What This Framework Is Not

English
	•	Not an algorithm
	•	Not a software system
	•	Not a decision engine
	•	Not a fixed ontology
	•	Not a prescriptive methodology

中文
	•	不是演算法
	•	不是可執行軟體
	•	不是自動決策系統
	•	不是封閉定義的本體論
	•	不是規範性流程

Core Idea

Judgment emerges from constraints, not from absolute rules.

判定不是來自單一規則，而是來自多個條件之間的關係。

Core conceptual elements include:
	•	Constraints
Explicit assumptions, boundaries, or limiting conditions.
	•	Reference Sets
Data, examples, standards, or prior cases used for comparison.
	•	Judgment Outcomes
Possible states such as:
	•	valid /成立
	•	invalid /不成立
	•	undetermined /未定
	•	context-dependent /依條件而異
	•	Uncertainty
What is missing, ambiguous, or sensitive to change.
	•	Minimal Irreducible Conditions
The smallest set of conditions that meaningfully affect the judgment.

Layered Structure

The framework is organized conceptually into layers rather than rigid modules.

Layer 0 — Core Judgment Logic

Defines the abstract structure of judgment:
	•	conditions
	•	constraints
	•	references
	•	uncertainty
	•	decision states

This layer describes how reasoning itself is formed.

⸻

Layer 1 — Interpretive Structures (Xuanling Layer)

An interpretive layer that organizes the core logic into reusable reasoning patterns.

This layer may include:
	•	structured prompts
	•	judgment schemas
	•	reusable condition blocks
	•	interpretation templates

It translates abstract judgment logic into usable reasoning forms.

⸻

Layer 2 — Projection & Application

This layer contains domain projections built on top of the framework.

Examples include:
	•	engineering reasoning
	•	specification review
	•	compliance comparison
	•	consistency checking
	•	scenario analysis
	•	cross-source verification

These are projections, not fixed implementations.

They illustrate how the framework may be mapped into real contexts without restricting future interpretations.

How to Read This Repository
	1.	Begin with the core conceptual files to understand the logic of constraint-based judgment
	2.	Read interpretive layers to see how reasoning structures are organized
	3.	Explore projection examples as illustrative mappings
	4.	Treat each part as modular and composable

Each file can be read independently while still contributing to a coherent whole.

⸻

Design Philosophy
	•	Open-ended rather than closed
	•	Constraint-driven rather than rule-driven
	•	Interpretable rather than opaque
	•	Modular rather than monolithic
	•	Evolvable rather than finalized

⸻

Intended Use

This framework may be used as:
	•	a thinking scaffold
	•	a reasoning reference
	•	a documentation structure
	•	a comparison framework
	•	a foundation for AI-assisted analysis
	•	a conceptual tool for research or design

It does not prescribe decisions; it structures how decisions may be examined.

⸻

Status

This repository represents an evolving conceptual framework.

It is intentionally incomplete and open to reinterpretation, extension, and reuse.

Later versions or projections may expand, refine, or operationalize specific aspects without replacing earlier layers.

Closing Note

DCP does not claim truth.

It offers a way to make reasoning visible.
